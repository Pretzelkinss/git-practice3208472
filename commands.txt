Git commands i've learned: 
git init - initialize a git repository
git status - view the current status of the repository, uncluding uncommitted modified files.
git add - stage changed files to be committed to HEAD repository
git commit - record specified changes to the repository. use -m to add a comment on what was changed.
git branch - create or list branches.
git checkout - switch branches.
